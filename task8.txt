What i learnt:

That createing an array with non const size on the stack is not
in the c++ standard.


What was difficult:

I didn't really think any of it was particularry hard, but I already have som 
experience with c++ so don't take my word for it.


How can the lab be improved:

A lot clearer instructions.
For example task3. Where we are given a tip to on how to pass arrays as paramters,
but it only works with static size, while the instruction says the array size shoud 
be taken dynamicly from the user.

I think I've spent around 6-8 hours on this lab
